# About

This organization is for anyone who enjoys following the drama and conflicts within the GitHub community. We collect the most controversial issues, pull requests, and heated debates from across various repositories. It's a chance to see examples of how not to behave in open-source projects and, let’s be honest, it’s also just fun to read through all the chaos.
